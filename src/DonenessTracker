Big Picture Things to Finish

- Replace CustomInput UX with direct editing on CheatSheet

# Known Bugs
- Level change doesn't reset prompt until after next key pressed :(
- Word Limit games should end without needing final spacebar
- Reduce conversions between strings and arrays? (I just have a feeling
  that there's some unnecessary back-and-forth going on here.)
