New Tests to Write
- Add translation layer for various layouts
- Enable keyboard mapping
- Replace CustomInput UX with direct editing on CheatSheet

# Known Bugs
- In LineByLine mode, points are only awarded by line
- Word Limit games should end without needing final spacebar
- Unused code needs removal
- Reduce conversions between strings and arrays? (I just have a feeling
  that there's some unnecessary back-and-forth going on here.)
