- Update the Tailwind base colors to better match my Figma mocks
- Add some fly-ins/outs?
- Do a 'naming pass' for consistency. E.g., is it "layoutMap" or "keyMap" or…something clearer?
- Replace BottomText with other attributions & stuff
- Documentation
- Publish to Netlify…maybe with custom domain
- Write dev.to post, & post to Reddits for ergodoz/moonlander/colemak

# 🐞 Known Bugs
- "Over-matching" fails to turn input red
  StR: Example line: "the hat that this"
    - Type "thee"
    Expected → Display has green "the" (because the error's on the space) & Input is red
    Actual → Display has green "the" but Input stays black
    Note: This is a model-level issue. Same bug in both old & new designs
- Keys should not highlight when clicked EXCEPT in Custom mode
- Custom map does not properly clear prior setting from level maps (and maybe we don't need to store all of those in localStorage?)
  - Custom map needs a bit of stress testing
- Still seing >100% accuracy from time to time. 🙀
- Encountered Capital "Sarah" when capitals not allowed (custom map)
- Holding down a modifier key gets ignored by combo handler. Might need to fork `svelte-keydown` or switch it out for `mousetrap`

# Playground & Tests

There are also two components accessible only through the super-secret easter-egg keyboard shortcut: ⌥T, which toggles the hierarchy to look like this ↓.

(App)
  Playground
  Tests

The Playground is a place to mess with idividual components and other Svelty things without having to worry about accidentally checking in breaking changes.

By contrast, Tests.svelte runs (and displays results for) a set of unit tests put together using a dead-simple pattern for tests that I came up with after deciding that I didn't have the patience to follow the multi-step instructions for Jest/Jasmine/Whatever integration since those things don't support ES6 out of the box. It's actually pretty fun to have the test results right in the browser.

It's easy enough to see how the tests work just by looking at the existing ones. Basically, each test result is passed to the display as a 2-part array: [description, result].

🥷 Pro tip: Add a 3rd element to the array to have JSON.stringified results appended below a given test. This is handy as a way to get a top-level view into a failing test (or a strangely-passing one) without having to console.log it. As with logging, I prefer not to check these things in, but if you do, at least they won't pollute the running app's console.

🤞 Note: I'm on a Mac. Hopefully alt-T has the same toggling effect on whatever other machines folks are using.

# Icebox
- Persist average accuracy
  - Surface in Results.svelte UX
  - Should be per-layout, per level
- Reduce conversions between strings and arrays? (I just have a feeling
  that there's some unnecessary back-and-forth going on here.)
  - Document every transition that uses .split/.join with either " " or "".
- Auto-select number input when using keyboard shortcuts for Word/Time limit modes
