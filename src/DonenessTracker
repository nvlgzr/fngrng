Big Picture Things to Finish

- Replace CustomInput UX with direct editing on CheatSheet
- Create keyboard shortcuts for rapid toggling/selection of prefs, keyboard mapping, and levels
  - Shortcut for Word/Time limits should open the prefs pane with input selected
    - and close on Return/Enter
- Fix the weird interaction between the levels & Full Sentence Mode
  - Make them mutually exclusive
- Replace "club" with some other title
- Provide option to swap in columnar layout
- Use different color scheme & fonts to differentiate from colemak.academy
- Persist average accuracy
- Replace BottomText with other attributions & stuff
- Add 'fngrng prefix to persistent store keys to avoid 3rd party conflicts'
- Do a 'naming pass' for consistency. E.g., is it "layoutMap" or "keyMap" orâ€¦something clearer?

# Known Bugs
- Word Limit games should end without needing final spacebar
- Reduce conversions between strings and arrays? (I just have a feeling
  that there's some unnecessary back-and-forth going on here.)
