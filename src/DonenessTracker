ðŸŸ¡ Work done this commit
ðŸ”œ Plan to work on next


Big Picture Things to Finish

- Replace CustomInput UX with direct editing on CheatSheet
- Randomize "Full Sentence Mode" inputs => gettysburg, dorian, maybe some Baldwin, Bronte, et al?

# Known Bugs
- Capital Letter prefs have no effect
- In LineByLine mode, points are only awarded by line
- Level change doesn't reset prompt until after next key pressed :(
- Word Limit games should end without needing final spacebar
- Animation not yet hooked up in LineByLinePrompt
- Unused code needs removal
- Reduce conversions between strings and arrays? (I just have a feeling
  that there's some unnecessary back-and-forth going on here.)
