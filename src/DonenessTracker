# Known Bugs

- 🐞 Fast typing can leave the prompt behind by one character (white n in "fan" issue)
  Hypothesis: more pure functions can help here. Maybe aim for a bunch of functions that take and return baseModel w/userText built in so that the UI
  is always 100% in-sync with the model??

- Clicking outside of preferences should dismiss prefs (but doesn't)
- Encapsulate reset so that prefs changes don't leave cruft in the UserInput
