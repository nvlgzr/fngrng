- Update the Tailwind base colors to better match my Figma mocks
- Adjust the layout to fit on anything from iPad to external monitor (maybe back to vh's?)
- Add some fly-ins/outs?
- Do a 'naming pass' for consistency. E.g., is it "layoutMap" or "keyMap" or…something clearer?
- Add tooltips to all controls…not just disabled Toggles.
- Replace BottomText with other attributions & stuff
- Standardize CSS spacing (I _think_ I prefer it with no blank lines…?)
- Documentation / README
- Publish to Netlify…maybe with custom domain
- Write dev.to post, & post to Reddits for ergodoz/moonlander/colemak
- Experiment: try replacing all arrow functions with `function`. Does anything break? Is it better? Worse? How?

# 🐞 Known Bugs
- It's annoying not to be able to change layouts mid-game, esp. since hover still turns the LayoutHeader green.
  - Change Hoverable => Dismiss Hover state if mouse has not moved within 3 (?) seconds
- Heisenbug: sometimes keypress goes to game, not custom thingy ❌
- Custom mode: words should be filtered out if punctuation isn't in the current letter set. StR: Set to Custom w/Punctuation on. Some words become unplayable when their punctuation isn't mapped.
- Weird keyboard blinking bug: set ARST, then click A ❌
  Expected → A blinks and gets brighter
  Actual → A blinks, but ARST all get brighter

- "Over-matching" fails to turn input red
  StR: Example line: "the hat that this"
    - Type "thee"
    Expected → Display has green "the" (because the error's on the space) & Input is red
    Actual → Display has green "the" but Input stays black
    Note: This is a model-level issue. Same bug in both old & new designs
- Custom prompt should be empty if no keys are mapped! (i.e., if the levels are empty). Includes level 7.
- Still seing >100% accuracy from time to time. 🙀
- Encountered Capital "Sarah" when capitals not allowed (custom map)

# Playground & Tests

There are also two components accessible only through the super-secret easter-egg keyboard shortcut: ⌥T, which toggles the hierarchy to look like this ↓.

(App)
  Playground
  Tests

The Playground is a place to mess with idividual components and other Svelty things without having to worry about accidentally checking in breaking changes.

By contrast, Tests.svelte runs (and displays results for) a set of unit tests put together using a dead-simple pattern for tests that I came up with after deciding that I didn't have the patience to follow the multi-step instructions for Jest/Jasmine/Whatever integration since those things don't support ES6 out of the box. It's actually pretty fun to have the test results right in the browser.

It's easy enough to see how the tests work just by looking at the existing ones. Basically, each test result is passed to the display as a 2-part array: [description, result].

🥷 Pro tip: Add a 3rd element to the array to have JSON.stringified results appended below a given test. This is handy as a way to get a top-level view into a failing test (or a strangely-passing one) without having to console.log it. As with logging, I prefer not to check these things in, but if you do, at least they won't pollute the running app's console.

🤞 Note: I'm on a Mac. Hopefully alt-T has the same toggling effect on whatever other machines folks are using.

# Icebox
- Persist average accuracy
  - Surface in Results.svelte UX
  - Should be per-layout, per level
- Reduce conversions between strings and arrays? (I just have a feeling
  that there's some unnecessary back-and-forth going on here.)
  - Document every transition that uses .split/.join with either " " or "".
- Auto-select number input when using keyboard shortcuts for Word/Time limit modes
- The entire site has had zero a11y effort put in so far, in part because I haven't used the tech & thus don't understand the issues at play.
- Toy with timeouts to make selecting a layout less distracting?
- Add affordance to show when key remapping's on.
- Game over: persist past scores & display median
- "reset ⌃R" command?
